				<p>Collaborytics is an analytics and visualization application for
				source code management systems. It's aim is to assist software
				development teams, architects, consultants and project managers to
				visualize various metrics that apply to software development projects.
				Strictly speaking, the repository being visualized doesn't have to be a
				source code repository, but could be a repository for, say,
				book-writing
				authors too.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Collaborytics helps users gain any useful information about a team's
				adherence to
				good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Source
				Code Management (SCM) </a>practices--such as <a
				 href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html">small
				and frequent checkins</a>--and good <a
				 href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">Extreme
				Programming
				(XP) practices</a>--such as <a
				 href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair rotations</a>
				and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collective
				code ownership</a>--by analyzing the evolution of a codebase in a
				repository over time.<br>
				<br>
				The motivation is to visualize metrics that developers, technical leads
				and consultants like myself will find useful for gaining insight into
				their software development process. For example, a popular social
				coding service, <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>, has some
				graphs to visualize <a
				 href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/graphs/impact">"Code
				Impact"</a> (lines added + lines deleted for all non-merge commits
				during a given timeframe) and <a
				 href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/graphs/punch_card">commit
				activity by day and hour</a>.<br>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>The questions that the minimum feature set
				answers are:<br>
				- How active is each contributor/developer?<br>
				- Are the contributors/developers making small and frequent changes or
				otherwise? (<a
				 href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html">More
				info on XP best practice of small and frequent checkins</a>.)<br>
				- What are the trends and outliers in file impact and files/checkin
				over time?<br>
				- What is the contribution level (# of unique contributors) for
				different time periods (or iterations)?<br>
				- How do the various metrics relate to each other (exploration of
				multidimensional metrics)?<br>
				<br>
				Some of the questions I would like to answer with the visualization in
				the future are:<br>
				- What are the most/least active areas of the codebase?<br>
				- Is there a good dispersion of code ownership amongst the developers? <br>
				- Who has more experience in what parts of the codebase?<br>
				- What are the trends in line impact and lines/checkin? This provides a
				lower level of granularity <br>
				<br>
				In the future, I would also like to incorporate other metrics such as <a
				 href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html">flog scores</a>, <a
				 href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/2008/11/how-toxic-is-your-code/">toxicity</a>
				and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic
				complexity</a>, but at the moment
				I'm more interested in spotting trends emerging from source control
				activity. Needless to say, we should always take software metrics with
				a grain of salt. I find them particularly useful in spotting trends and
				outliers and not in arriving at black or white conclusions.</p>
