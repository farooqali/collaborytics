= XForge Changelog

== Version 0.1.4

This is the first functional release of XForge, a Ruby library and Rake task to automate release of
files on RubyForge and other SourceForge clones.

It's as simple as this:

require 'xforge'

desc "Create a new release on RubyForge"
task :publish_files => [:gem] do
  release_files = FileList[
    "pkg/#{PKG_FILE_NAME}.gem"
  ]

  Rake::XForge::Release.new(PKG_NAME) do |release|
    # Never hardcode user name and password in the Rakefile!
    release.user_name = ENV['RUBYFORGE_USER']
    release.password = ENV['RUBYFORGE_PASSWORD']
    release.files = release_files.to_a
    release.release_name = "XForge #{PKG_VERSION}"
    # The rest of the options are defaults (among others, release_notes and release_changes, parsed from CHANGES)
  end
end
